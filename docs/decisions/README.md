# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the **TransparentTorProxy (TTP)** project.

## Purpose

ADRs serve as a light-weight record of significant design and architectural choices made during the development of TTP. They document:

* **Context**: What was the problem and the environment at the time?
* **Decision**: What choice was made to address it?
* **Consequences**: What are the positive, negative, and neutral trade-offs of that choice?

## Structure of an ADR

Each ADR is formatted using the Markdown standard and named using a sequential ID:

* `0001-some-decision.md`
* `0002-another-decision.md`
