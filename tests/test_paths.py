"""Tests for ``ttp.paths`` - trusted resolution of the binaries TTP runs as root.

The headline test is :func:`test_a_hostile_nft_on_path_is_not_executed`. Without
it, replacing bare names with ``resolve()`` is a refactor; with it, the property
that matters is asserted: **an attacker who controls $PATH cannot choose which
program TTP executes with full privileges.**

That is not a theoretical concern. TTP is invoked through ``sudo``, and while
``sudo`` normally sanitises PATH via ``secure_path``, that is a distribution
default an administrator can switch off - not a security guarantee TTP is
entitled to assume.
