## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a professional and respectful environment. Please be kind to others.

## How to Report Bugs

- **Check existing issues**: Someone might have already reported it.
- **Use the template**: Provide as much detail as possible.
- **Diagnostics**: Always include the output of `sudo ttp diagnose` if the bug is related to connectivity or system configuration.

## How to Propose Features

- Open an issue titled `[Feature Request] Your idea`.
- Explain why this feature is needed and how it fits the project's goal of simplicity and crash-safety.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onyks-os/TransparentTorProxy.git
   cd TransparentTorProxy
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install in editable mode with dev dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > To run the firewall ruleset validation tests (`tests/test_nse_rules.py`), you must also install the `nse` extras:
>
   > ```bash
   > pip install -e ".[nse]"
   > ```
>
   > `network-sandbox-engine` provides the namespace/nftables orchestration API. `pyroute2` enables netlink-based route setup inside namespaces without requiring `/sys` mount permissions (needed for Docker compatibility).

1. **Run tests**:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

## Coding Standards

All contributions must conform to the following standards before being submitted. These checks are enforced automatically by the CI pipeline.

- **Linting & Formatting**: Python code must pass `ruff check` and `ruff format` without errors or warnings.
- **Shell Scripts**: All bash/shell scripts in `scripts/` and elsewhere must pass `shellcheck` without errors.
- **Style Conventions**: Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) naming and style conventions. `ruff` enforces this automatically.
- **Type Annotations**: New functions and methods must include type annotations for all parameters and return values, consistent with the existing codebase.
- **No dead code**: Remove unused imports, variables, and commented-out code blocks before submitting a PR.

> PRs that fail `ruff check` or `shellcheck` linting will not be merged.

## Architectural Principles

When writing code for TTP, please adhere to these core principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each module should do one thing. Keep UI logic (`rich`/`typer`) in `cli.py` and system logic in dedicated modules.
2. **No UI Coupling**: Modules like `tor_control.py` or `ttp/firewall/` should NOT import `rich` or `typer`. Use callbacks or return raw data.
3. **Atomic Operations**: System changes (like firewall rules) must be atomic. We use `nft -f` to ensure the firewall is never in a half-configured state.
4. **Crash-Safety**: Always consider what happens if the power goes out mid-operation. Use the lock file system in `state.py` to track changes that need rolling back.
5. **TDD (Test Driven Development)**: Every new feature or bug fix should include a corresponding unit test in `tests/`.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Must pass on every PR. They are fully mocked and run without root.
- **Integration Tests**: Should be run in a VM (see `README.md`) to verify actual network behavior.

### When Tests Run

- **Pull Requests**: Every PR automatically triggers the CI pipeline (GitHub Actions). The following checks are executed:
  - Linting with `ruff check` and `ruff format`
  - Shell scripting linting with ShellCheck
  - Unit tests on Python versions 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13
- **Push to Main**: The same suite of tests and checks is run on any push to the main branch.
- **Locally**: You can (and should) run `pytest tests/ -v` locally before submitting your pull request.

### Interpreting Results

- **All tests pass (green)**: The code is ready for review and potential merge.
- **Any test fails (red)**: Blocks the merge. Review the logs, correct the issue, and push the updates.

### Test Policy for Major Changes

A change is considered **major** if it:

- Adds a new significant feature (e.g., a new CLI command).
- Modifies the firewall rules (`nftables`) or DNS resolution management.
- Alters the crash-safety architecture.

In these cases, the contributor **must**:

- Add new unit tests to cover the functionality.
- Update existing tests if the expected behavior changes.
- Manually run integration tests in a virtual machine (VM).

Pull requests will be blocked from merging if tests do not sufficiently cover the changes.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

By contributing to TTP, you certify that you have the right to submit the contribution under the project's MIT license, and you agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin v1.1](https://developercertificate.org/).

**Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` line** with your real name and email:

```text
Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
```

The easiest way to add it is with the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "your commit message"
```

For multiple commits in a branch, you can amend them all at once:

```bash
git rebase --signoff HEAD~<number-of-commits>
```

> PRs with unsigned commits will not be merged. The DCO check is enforced automatically by the CI pipeline.

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Ensure your code passes all linting checks (`ruff check`, `shellcheck`) and unit tests.
3. Update the documentation (`README.md`, `architecture.md`) if needed.
4. Submit the PR and wait for review.

Thank you for your help!

## Security Best Practices for GitHub Actions

When contributing workflows or modifying existing CI pipelines, follow these guidelines to prevent injection attacks.

### 1. Never interpolate untrusted data directly into shell commands

**Bad** (vulnerable to script injection):

```yaml
- run: echo "PR title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"
```

**Good** (use environment variables):

```yaml
- env:
    PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
  run: echo "PR title: $PR_TITLE"
```

### 2. Avoid using `pull_request_target` unless strictly necessary

This trigger runs in the context of the base repository and can expose secrets to malicious code from a fork. Prefer `pull_request` instead.

### 3. Use official actions from trusted sources

Prefer actions from `actions/`, `github/`, or verified publishers. Review third-party actions for security before adding.

### 4. Limit `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions

Set minimal permissions at workflow level:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

### 5. Sanitize inputs from `github.event.issue.body` or `github.event.comment.body`

If you must use user-provided text, validate it against an allowlist or escape special characters before passing to scripts.

### 6. Run untrusted code in isolated containers

For actions that execute code from PRs (e.g., linters on forked repos), consider running them inside a Docker container with no access to secrets.
