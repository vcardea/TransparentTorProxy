# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] - 0.4.8 (Verification Debt)

The theme of this cycle is one defect repeated across the project: **a check that
could not fail.** A green suite is only worth what it excludes, and several of
TTP's loudest guarantees were being checked by things that would have passed
regardless.

### Added

- **The zero-leak suite actually runs.** `tests/test_nse_rules.py` — the evidence
  behind the README's strongest claim — had no make target, no CI job, no step in
  `scripts/verify.sh`, and its `nse` marker is excluded from the default pytest
  run. It now has `make test-nse`, a **Zero-leak ruleset verification** CI job on
  every push, and a step in the pre-release pipeline.
- **Positive controls in every containment test.** `assert len(leaks) == 0` is
  also true when the sniffer never started, when the interface name is wrong, or
  when the traffic never left the process. Each test now runs its stimulus twice:
  once with the ruleset **flushed**, where the packet MUST be observed, and then
  with TTP's ruleset, where it must not. A harness that cannot see a leak fails
  the test instead of passing it.
- **Wider leak coverage**: plain DNS over UDP *and* TCP, ordinary TCP, DoT on
  853, QUIC DoH on UDP/443 (the path NAT cannot redirect), ICMP, arbitrary UDP,
  and IPv6 — plus the reverse assertion that a bypassed UID still reaches the
  LAN, so a firewall that blocked everything cannot pass.
- **`TTP_REQUIRE_NSE=1`**: turns a missing, shadowed or too-old NSE into a hard
  error instead of a skip. `nse` is a short import name that an unrelated PyPI
  package can shadow, which looked identical to "NSE is not installed" and
  silently skipped the whole module.
- **Deterministic sandbox**: permanent neighbour entries for the veth gateway, so
  the first packet of a run is not held for ARP/NDP resolution — which the
  sniffer's `not arp` filter hid, making the positive control fail for reasons
  unrelated to the firewall.
- **Coverage ratchet**: `make coverage` enforces a floor (currently 85%) and runs
  in CI.
- **ShellCheck and markdownlint now run.** `make lint` invoked them when present
  and printed "skipping" when not, and they had never been installed on the
  runner — so two of the four linters in the gate did nothing. Both are installed
  in CI, the job asserts they are on PATH, and the ~440 markdown findings they had
  accumulated are fixed.
- **`--strict-markers`**: a typo in a pytest marker silently deselects the test it
  was meant to tag.
- **Release rehearsal in CI**: `make packages` runs on every push, asserting that
  every artifact the release job signs was actually produced and that `twine
  check` passes on the distributions. `packaging/release.sh` skips the `.rpm`
  when `rpmbuild` is absent and still exits 0, so a missing build tool used to
  produce a silently incomplete release - discovered only at tag time, when the
  tag already existed.

### Changed

- **Behavioural CLI Test Suite**: Rewrote `tests/test_cli_*.py` (`test_cli_stop.py`, `test_cli_start.py`, `test_cli_bypass.py`, `test_cli_misc.py`) to move mocking out of CLI logic to system boundaries (`_run_nft_string`, `sys.exit`, `os.geteuid`), asserting on rendered `nftables` rulesets, produced lock files, and CLI outputs instead of internal call sequences.
- **Test coverage 80% → 86%**, 295 tests → 428. The modules that were least
  covered were the ones handling state and input, exactly as `ROADMAP.md` noted:
  `_ports.py` 45% → 100%, `_validation.py` 58% → 98%, `tor_install.py` 64% → 100%,
  `state.py` 66% → 99%, `firewall/builder.py` 79% → 100%, `ux.py` 57% → 100%.
- **`network-sandbox-engine` pinned to `>=2.1.0,<3`** (was `>=1.1.1`, open across
  a major that had already rewritten `run_test_pipeline`'s signature). 2.1.0 is a
  floor and not a preference: before it, the NSE runner reported PASSED when its
  oracle observed nothing, and its trace monitor could stop reading mid-run
  without saying so. A green leak suite against an older engine would not have
  been evidence of anything.
- **`inotify_watch_lost()` extracted** from the watchdog's `while True` loop. It
  decides whether `/etc/resolv.conf` was unmounted or replaced under the DNS
  overlay — the moment a leak becomes possible — and was previously reachable
  only by running the daemon. It is now a pure function with 14 tests, including
  the truncated-read case that would have raised inside the loop.

### Security

- **PATH hijacking closed (`ruff S607` x47).** `nft`, `ip`, `systemctl` and
  fifteen other binaries were invoked **by name** from a process running as
  root, so the kernel resolved them through `$PATH`. Anyone able to influence
  the environment of the `sudo` invocation could put their own `nft` earlier in
  the search order and have it executed with full privileges - a local privilege
  escalation in a tool whose whole job is to be trusted with the network stack.

  `sudo` usually blunts this with `secure_path`, but that is a distribution
  default an administrator can switch off, not a property TTP is entitled to
  assume.

  New `ttp/paths.py` resolves every binary against a fixed list of root-owned
  system directories, never `$PATH`, and refuses to execute one that is
  group- or world-writable, or that sits in a writable directory - write access
  there is enough to replace the file by rename. `resolve_optional()` covers the
  binaries TTP uses when they happen to exist (`notify-send`, the SELinux
  tools), so a missing nicety cannot turn into a failed teardown while the
  killswitch is firing; a *replaceable* one still raises.

  21 tests, the load-bearing one being `test_a_hostile_nft_on_path_is_not_executed`
  and its end-to-end sibling, which plants a hostile `nft` first on `$PATH` and
  asserts the argv TTP hands to `subprocess` still names the trusted absolute
  path. Without those this would be a refactor, not a fix. A further test keeps
  `S607` selected in `make lint`, because a rule silently dropped from the
  config is how 47 call sites appear in the first place.

- **Four more PATH lookups `ruff S607` could not see.** The rule only flags a
  bare name in an argv list, so it missed `shutil.which()` results that are then
  executed: the `tor` path written into the systemd unit's `ExecStart` (the worst
  of them - it decides what systemd launches as root for the lifetime of the unit
  file, not just the current process), `systemd-run` for `ttp bypass`, `dig` for
  leak checking, and `conntrack` during teardown. Plus the pluggable-transport
  path written into `torrc`, which Tor itself executes. All now go through the
  trusted lookup, and a test asserts `shutil.which` does not come back anywhere
  its result would be run - the only surviving use picks which package-manager
  hint to print, and is never executed.

- **Container base images pinned by digest** (`scripts/vm/Dockerfile.*.test`).
  These images decide which nftables and kernel headers the integration suite
  runs against, so a moving tag silently changes the environment a passing test
  was measured in.

### Fixed

- **`make coverage` could not run.** It invokes `pytest --cov`, but `pytest-cov`
  was in neither the `dev` extra nor any environment, so the target failed with
  `unrecognized arguments: --cov=ttp`. The 80% figure in the roadmap was not
  reproducible by the documented command.
- **`docs/architecture.md`**: a table-of-contents link pointed at an anchor that
  does not exist.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **Strict No Auto-Install Policy**: Project-wide policy enforcement prohibiting automatic package installations. If required binaries (`tor`, `obfs4proxy`, `snowflake-client`) are missing, TTP displays distro-aware package installation guidance (`apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `zypper`), official Tor Project documentation URLs, and gracefully exits with status code `0`.
- **`tor_config` & `tor_service` Submodules**: Refactored `tor_install.py` by extracting pure `torrc` configuration generation into `ttp/tor_config.py` and volatile `systemd` service lifecycle management into `ttp/tor_service.py`.
- **`ttp/firewall/` Package Architecture**: Converted `firewall.py` into a specialized package `ttp/firewall/` composed of `builder.py` (pure ruleset string generator), `runner.py` (`nft` execution engine & atomic cleanup), and `emergency.py` (lockdown, socket slaughter, emergency killswitch).
- **HTTP/3 (QUIC) Anti-DoH Prevention**: Added explicit `udp dport 443 reject` rules for public DoH IPv4/IPv6 resolver IP sets to prevent browser HTTP/3 QUIC DoH bypasses.
- **Explicit Ruff Code Quality Rules**: Added `pyproject.toml` configuration enforcing `isort`, `flake8-bugbear`, `pyupgrade`, `flake8-simplify`, `flake8-logging-format`, and performance lints (`E`, `F`, `W`, `I`, `B`, `UP`, `SIM`, `G`, `PIE`, `RUF`, `PERF`). Added `make format` target for automated formatting and lint fixing.
- **Start Command Submodule Extraction**: Refactored `ttp/commands/start.py` by extracting pre-flight checks into `ttp/commands/_preflight.py` and Tor setup into `ttp/commands/_tor_setup.py`.
- **Application Exclusion via cgroups v2 Bypass (`ttp bypass`)**: Added the new `ttp bypass <command>` CLI command. This command de-escalates privileges securely to the invoking user and runs the target application inside a systemd transient scope under `ttp-bypass.slice` using `systemd-run`.
- **cgroups v2 Firewall Rules**: Configured `apply_rules()` to inject `socket cgroupv2 level 1 "ttp-bypass.slice" accept` into the `output` NAT and `filter_out` filter chains, allowing any processes running inside the slice to bypass Tor transparent proxying atomically.
- **Privilege-Separated Watchdog User**: Added system user and group `ttp-watchdog` configuration to run the background watchdog daemon with only `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capabilities instead of root (`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`).
- **Polkit Authorization Rules**: Added `ttp/resources/polkit/50-ttp-watchdog.rules` to authorize the `ttp-watchdog` user to restart the Tor daemon and watchdog services via systemd without elevated privileges.
- **Fail-Closed Watchdog Policy**: Modified the watchdog to implement a strict fail-closed policy. Under DNS overlay mount or firewall tampering/failure, the watchdog immediately applies the emergency killswitch and halts (rather than attempting unsafe file-modifying operations without root privileges).
- **Arch, Debian, RPM, and Installer Integration**: Updated installers and packages to dynamically create the `ttp-watchdog` system user and group, deploy the Polkit policy rule, and clean them up during uninstallation.
- **CLI Thin Orchestrator (Modularization)**: Refactored the monolithic `cli.py` (previously over 1200 lines) into a pure, thin Typer orchestrator (under 150 lines). All operational logic has been extracted into isolated command modules under `ttp/commands/` (e.g., `start.py`, `stop_restart.py`, `session.py`, `admin.py`, `watchdog.py`), dramatically improving maintainability and testability.
- **Micro-Sleep Teardown Optimization**: Refined the "Zero-Leak" graceful shutdown sequence. Reduced the socket slaughter wait time from 1.5 seconds down to a precise 300ms micro-sleep, significantly accelerating the shutdown process without compromising the delivery of TCP RST and ICMP Port Unreachable packets.
- **Protocol-Specific Socket Slaughter**: Hardened the Active Socket Slaughter implementation by explicitly targeting UDP connections with `meta l4proto udp counter reject` rather than relying on a generic reject, ensuring precise ICMP error generation for pending connections.

### Changed

- **Machine-Dependent SELinux Test Broke CI for Three Weeks**: `test_remove_selinux_module` patched `ttp.tor_detect.shutil.which` while `remove_selinux_module()` probed `Path("/usr/sbin/semodule").exists()` directly. The real filesystem check therefore ran unmocked: the test passed on a Fedora workstation and failed on every GitHub runner, leaving `TTP CI` red on `main` since 2026-08-13. The production probe now uses `shutil.which("semodule")`, consistent with how the same module already locates `checkmodule` and `semodule_package`, and the test patches the symbol the code actually calls.
- **Documentation Workflow Missing a Declared Plugin**: `mkdocs.yml` declares the `mkdocstrings` plugin but `.github/workflows/docs.yml` installed only `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material`, so every documentation build aborted with `The "mkdocstrings" plugin is not installed`. The workflow now installs `mkdocstrings[python]` and additionally fails if `docs/web/release-notes/changelog.md` has drifted from the root `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **DCO Check Blocked Automated Dependency Updates**: the sign-off gate required a `Signed-off-by` trailer on every commit, including Dependabot's, which never carries one. Bot commits are now skipped: the DCO is an assertion by a human contributor about their right to submit code, which an automated version bump does not make.
- **CI Enforces the Makefile Contract**: the `lint` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` reimplemented `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` by hand and had drifted from `make lint`, which also runs `mypy`, ShellCheck over `packaging/`, and the tracked-file secret scan. As a result **no workflow ran mypy at all**. Both the `lint` and `unit-tests` jobs, and `scripts/verify.sh`, now delegate to `make lint` and `make test` so CI and local verification cannot diverge from the documented contract again.
- **Type Annotations Pass Under mypy**: resolved the 24 errors surfaced by adding mypy to the lint gate - 16 through configuration (`stem` ships no `py.typed`; `transitions.Machine` attaches FSM triggers at runtime) and 8 in the code, covering a `socket | None` dereference in the watchdog FSM, an invalid `select()` source list, and unchecked `Any` returns from third-party JSON verification endpoints.
- **Release Workflow Gating**: the release job now verifies that the pushed tag matches the version in `pyproject.toml`, runs `make lint` and `make test` before building, and asserts that every expected artifact exists before signing. Previously a tag could publish an unverified build, and `packaging/release.sh` skipping the `.rpm` when `rpmbuild` is absent would still exit 0.
- **Standardized Error Handling**: Unified CLI error handling across `_validation.py` and `watchdog.py` to consistently raise `typer.Exit(code=1)` with Rich formatted error panels.
- **Flaky NSE Test Resolution**: Hardened `test_bypassed_user_escape` in `tests/test_nse_rules.py` with ARP cache warmup, Scapy sniffer initialization delays, and multi-packet transmissions.
- **Systemd Hard Requirement**: Declared systemd as strictly required for TTP. Start, restart, and bypass CLI commands check for systemd on startup and fail immediately with a descriptive error message if missing. Removed references to systemd-less environments, Alpine Linux, or Void Linux in documents, ADRs, and help strings.
- **Bypass Command Sudo Check**: Improved the `ttp bypass` CLI command to fail early with a clean, descriptive error message ("This command must be run with sudo to safely delegate privileges via systemd-run.") if executed without `sudo` or outside a `sudo` environment.

### Fixed

- **PyPI Publication Was Never Automated**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` created the GitHub Release but had no publication step, so `v0.4.7` shipped signed artifacts to GitHub while PyPI stayed on `0.4.5` and TestPyPI on `0.4.0`. The workflow now publishes to TestPyPI, installs the result from TestPyPI and smoke tests it (console script runs, package imports, version matches the tag), and only then publishes to PyPI. Both uploads use PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC), so no API token is stored anywhere. The publishing jobs upload the exact wheel and sdist that Sigstore signed, rather than rebuilding: `make publish`/`make publish-test` rebuild from the working tree and are now documented as manual recovery paths only, since what they push corresponds to no published signature.

- **Release Pipeline Target Drift (release-blocking)**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `scripts/verify.sh` still invoked `make build`, which after the Makefile modularization only produces the Python sdist and wheel into `dist/`. The native `.deb`/`.rpm`/`SHA256SUMS.txt` artifacts that both the Sigstore signing step and the GitHub Release upload consume are produced by `make packages` (`packaging/release.sh`) into `packaging/`. Tagging a release would have published an empty or incomplete asset set. Both callers now use `make packages`.
- **Non-Atomic Firewall Table Replacement**: `apply_rules()` and `apply_emergency_killswitch()` issued `nft add table`, `nft flush table`, and the ruleset injection as three separate `nft` invocations - three independent kernel transactions. Between the flush and the injection the `inet ttp` table existed but was empty, providing neither redirection nor drop, so traffic egressed in cleartext. Both paths now submit the table reset and the ruleset as a single `nft -f` transaction via the new `_apply_table_atomically()` helper. This was most severe in the killswitch, which by definition runs when session integrity has already been lost.
- **Silent Fail-Open During Teardown**: `apply_teardown_lockdown()` and `apply_active_socket_slaughter()` caught every `Exception` and logged it at `debug` level with the assumption that the table was already gone. A genuine `nft` failure - permissions, a corrupted chain, a missing binary - therefore opened a cleartext window during `ttp stop` and left no record above debug. Failures are now classified: a missing table or chain stays at `debug`, anything else is logged at `warning` with an explicit leak-window notice.
- **`ttp restart` Crash on Every Invocation Without Bridge Flags**: `restart_command()` forwarded arguments to `start_command()` through a conditionally-populated `**kwargs` dict, omitting any parameter whose value was `None` or `False`. Because `start_command()` is called directly as a Python function rather than through the Typer parser, an omitted parameter took its signature default - a truthy `typer.OptionInfo` sentinel, not `None`. `_parse_bridges()` then raised `TypeError: 'bool' object is not callable` on `bridge_file`, and `_parse_bypass_users_groups()` raised `TypeError: 'OptionInfo' object is not iterable` on `bypass_user`. All parameters are now forwarded explicitly.
- **`packaging/build_deb.sh` Wheel Path Resolution**: replaced an unquoted `ls` glob (ShellCheck SC2086) with a direct path construction and an explicit existence check, so a missing wheel fails with a readable message instead of a word-splitting surprise.
- **Stale `twine` Floor Broke the Local Release Build**: `packaging/release.sh` aborted at step 0 with `InvalidDistribution: '2.5' is not a valid metadata version`. hatchling >=1.32 emits `Metadata-Version: 2.5`, and `twine` only learned to validate it in 7.0.0; the dev extra floor was `twine>=6.2.0`, so any environment holding an older resolved twine failed the build. Raised to `twine>=7.0.0` and added an explicit `hatchling>=1.27` floor to `[build-system]`.
- **Package Builds Inherited the Operator's umask**: `build_deb.sh`, `build_rpm.sh` and `release.sh` created their staging trees with whatever umask the operator happened to have. Under a hardened `umask 027` the `DEBIAN/` control directory came out `750` and `dpkg-deb` refused to build at all (`control directory has bad permissions 750`), making local release builds impossible on such machines; more subtly, the file modes inside the published packages varied with who ran the build. All three scripts now set `umask 022` explicitly.
- **README Native Package Paths**: the installation instructions pointed at `./packaging/transparent-tor-proxy_<version>_all.deb`, a path that never exists in a fresh clone because the built packages are gitignored release assets. The instructions now direct users to the GitHub release assets.

## [0.4.6] - unreleased

Version 0.4.6 was built (2026-07-21) but never tagged or published: no `v0.4.6` tag
exists and no release assets were ever distributed. The work from that cycle - the
watchdog Finite State Machine, the `dns.py` refactoring, the `cli.py` split into
`ttp/commands/`, and the permissions/timeout hardening - shipped as part of 0.4.7
above. The version number is recorded here so the history has no silent gap.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Zero-Leak Shutdown (Graceful Teardown with Active Socket Slaughter)**: Implemented a multi-stage active socket termination and lockdown sequence during `ttp stop` to eliminate in-flight cleartext traffic leaks. Before final firewall ruleset removal, a temporary lockdown drop rule is applied (exempting the Tor daemon), followed by an **Active Socket Slaughter** phase injecting TCP Reset (`meta l4proto tcp counter reject with tcp reset`) and standard reject rules with a 1.5-second micro-delay. This actively terminates pending local connections before lowering the firewall.
- **Connection Tracking Flush**: Added automatic Netfilter connection tracking state invalidation via `conntrack -F` (when the `conntrack` utility is available) to terminate active TCP/UDP streams before final firewall ruleset removal.
- **IPv6 Force Disable Flag**: Added `--no-ipv6` CLI option to `start` and `restart` commands, allowing users to force drop all outbound IPv6 traffic via `nftables` rules (`meta nfproto ipv6 drop`) to prevent leaks even if the host machine supports IPv6.
- **System Integrity Watchdog Auto-Healing for IPv6**: Integrated `--no-ipv6` state checking into the session watchdog. During auto-healing operations, the watchdog reads the state lock and correctly re-applies firewall, DNS, and Tor configurations with IPv6 disabled if configured.
- **CLI Reports for IPv6 Status**: Updated `status` and `check` commands to explicitly show the status of IPv6 traffic routing: `Enabled (Redirected)`, `Disabled (Force Dropped)`, or `Disabled (Not supported by host)`.
- **Bring Your Own Daemon (BYOD) Mode**: Added `--external-daemon` and `--tor-uid` CLI options to both `start` and `restart` commands, allowing TTP to run on systemd-less environments (such as Alpine Linux or Void Linux) and inside lightweight Docker containers.
- **Passive Health Check & UID Parser**: Implemented socket owner auto-detection reading `/proc/net/tcp` and `/proc/net/tcp6` to find Tor's numeric UID (resolving firewall loops), alongside passive TCP/UDP port checks on the target ports when using `--external-daemon`.
- **Network Sandbox Engine (NSE) Integration**: Fully integrated the PyPI package `network-sandbox-engine` and `pyroute2` for automated ruleset tests.
- **Zero-Leak PCAP Ruleset Test**: Added `tests/test_nse_rules.py` to validate `nftables` schemas in isolated namespaces, using an asynchronous Scapy sniffer to assert zero cleartext packets escaping to the WAN.
- **Chaos Monkey Stress Test**: Introduced `tests/chaos_monkey.py` to verify watchdog/killswitch auto-healing resilience under injected failures.
- **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**: Created a dedicated `docs/decisions/` directory containing records for all major architectural decisions (0001 through 0008) made since project inception.
- **Split Tunneling by UID/GID**: Added `--bypass-user` and `--bypass-group` options to the `start` and `restart` CLI commands. These options accept usernames or groupnames (supporting individual values, comma-separated lists, or multiple flags), resolve them dynamically to numeric UIDs/GIDs via standard Python `pwd`/`grp` libraries, and store them in the session lock file `ttp.lock`.
- **Bypass Firewall Exceptions**: Generates `meta skuid <uid> accept` and `meta skgid <gid> accept` nftables rules placed at the top of the output, prerouting, and filter_out chains. This allows bypassed users and groups to access the cleartext internet directly, bypassing both Tor NAT redirection and the emergency killswitch.
- **Watchdog Bypass Auto-Healing**: Updated the background watchdog daemon to read the bypassed users/groups from the session lock file, dynamically verify that their firewall bypass rules are active in the running nftables ruleset, and trigger auto-healing to restore them if missing or modified.
- **Strict Lock Permissions**: The volatile lock file `/run/ttp/ttp.lock` is now created/updated with strict `0o644` permissions to protect active session state from unauthorized write access.
- **`docs/interfaces.md`** (OSPS-SA-02.01): New authoritative reference for all external interfaces — full CLI command table with options, exit codes and root-privilege requirements; Tor integration (managed ports, control protocol, `torrc` directives, pluggable transports); system integration (nftables table/chain/rule-order, DNS bind-mount overlay, volatile systemd units, filesystem path inventory); and external network endpoints used for verification.
- **`docs/bridges.md`**: New user guide for obtaining, configuring, and verifying Tor Bridges and Pluggable Transports (`obfs4`, `snowflake`) in TTP.
- **`docs/documentation-policy.md`**: New repository policy specifying required tests, changelog, and component documentation updates for each type of repository modification.
- **`docs/security-assessment.md`** (OSPS-SA-03.01): New STRIDE threat model and risk assessment covering all TTP components (`firewall.py`, `dns.py`, `tor_install.py`/`tor_control.py`, `state.py`, `watchdog.py`, `cli.py`), trust boundary diagram, known limitations table with severity ratings, supply chain security controls, and a 16-item security controls summary matrix.
- **`MAINTAINERS.md`**: New governance document listing Project Lead, a `## Project Roles` table mapping each operational role (Code Reviewer, Release Manager, Security Officer, CI/CD Maintainer) to its current holder, access to sensitive resources, merge policy, and maintainer onboarding/offboarding process.
- **`DEPENDENCIES.md`**: New dependency policy document covering runtime and dev/build Python dependencies with version constraints and licenses, system-level dependencies, optional dynamic dependencies (SELinux tools, pluggable transports), and policies for vetting, version pinning, vulnerability monitoring (`pip-audit --path .`), and upgrading.

### Changed

- **`README.md` Optimization**: Replaced the redundant and detailed `How It Works` section with a high-level summary and direct link to the authoritative `docs/architecture.md` documentation.
- **RPM Packaging Builder & CI**: Added `--nodeps` to `rpmbuild` in `packaging/build_rpm.sh` to prevent build-time dependency checking failures in Debian/Ubuntu-based environments lacking an RPM database. Updated the GitHub Actions release workflow to install `checkpolicy` and `policycoreutils-python-utils` for compiling the SELinux policy, and added fallback macro definitions for `%python3_sitelib` and `%_unitdir` in `packaging/ttp.spec` to support building on non-RPM hosts.

### Fixed

- **Garbage Collection Namespace Bug**: Fixed premature namespace teardown in integration tests by maintaining a reference to the `ns_sandbox` generator fixture context.
- **Multicast Filtering in Leak sniffer**: Added IGMP/multicast/NDP packet exclusions to prevent false-positive leak assertions in ruleset tests.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Native Transparent IPv6 Support**: Implemented dynamic IPv6 loopback detection, generating dual-stack or IPv4-only configurations depending on system availability. Added comprehensive IPv6 `nftables` rules for DNS/TCP redirection, loopback exemptions, and RFC 4193/RFC 3927 local range bypassing.
- **Network Resilient Watchdog**: Watchdog service now detects physical network carrier drops and default route removal. Under network offline states, watchdog checks are safely suspended to prevent false-positive emergency lockouts, automatically resuming after link reconnection and circuit stabilization.
- **Structured JSON Logging**: Added global `--log-format` command-line option supporting `text` and `json` outputs. Selecting `json` configures stdout/stderr and file log outputs to emit single-line structured JSON records with UTC ISO 8601 timestamps, log levels, logger namespaces, messages, and exception stack traces.
- **Extended DoH Domain Blocking**: Added `MapAddress` entries in `torrc` to neutralize DoH canary domains for Cloudflare (`use-application-dns.net`), Google, Quad9, OpenDNS, and AdGuard, signalling DoH-compliant browsers to fall back to the system resolver (which is safely routed through Tor).
- **DoH IP-Level Blocking**: Added `filter_out` nftables rules to reject TCP port 443 traffic destined for well-known DoH resolver IPs (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, OpenDNS) - both IPv4 and IPv6 - as a defence-in-depth measure against non-compliant browsers that ignore the canary domain.
- **CI/CD: Ruff Format Check**: Added `ruff format --check` as the first step in `scripts/verify.sh` to enforce consistent formatting before any other pipeline step.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Added `## Coding Standards` section (ruff check/format commands, PEP 8 reference, type annotation requirement, no-dead-code rule) and `## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)` section (sign-off requirement, `git commit -s` instructions, `git rebase --signoff` for retroactive signing, full DCO v1.1 text in collapsible block). Both sections added to the Table of Contents.
- **`docs/architecture.md`**: Removed duplicated content now canonical in `interfaces.md`. Section 4 (CLI command list) replaced with a cross-reference. Section 3.3 (`firewall.py`) condensed to design principles only, with execution order detail referenced from `interfaces.md § 3.1`. Section 3.4 (`dns.py`) condensed to design rationale only, with attribute table referenced from `interfaces.md § 3.2`. Section 3.6 (`cli.py`) trimmed to remove inline command enumeration, referencing `interfaces.md § 1`.
- **`README.md`**: `## Known Behavior` section renamed to `## Known Behavior & Limitations` and condensed — verbose inline explanations removed in favour of a reference to `docs/security-assessment.md` as the single source of truth for the risk breakdown.
- **`SECURITY.md`**: `## Scope` bullet list condensed to a one-sentence summary with a cross-reference to `docs/security-assessment.md` for the full threat model.
- **`docs/security-assessment.md`**: Dependency monitoring table (§ 5.2) replaced with a cross-reference to `DEPENDENCIES.md § 2.3` as the authoritative source for CVE scanning and Dependabot configuration.

### Fixed

- **Critical: DNS Leak via LAN Bypass Rule Ordering** (`firewall.py`): The `nftables` `output` chain evaluated the LAN bypass rule (`ip daddr { 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 } accept`) *before* the DNS redirect rule. Browsers that cache the LAN gateway (e.g. `192.168.1.1:53`) as their DNS resolver would have their queries accepted by the LAN bypass and sent directly to the ISP resolver - bypassing Tor entirely. The DNS redirect rule now runs *before* the LAN bypass in both the `output` and `prerouting` chains. Discovered via manual leak testing on [browserleaks.com/dns](https://browserleaks.com/dns).
- **Watchdog: Passive Tor Health Check (False Negative)** (`watchdog.py`): `check_system_integrity()` was verifying Tor health via `ctrl.close()`, a local Python object operation that succeeds even when the Tor daemon has crashed and only a stale socket file remains. Replaced with `ctrl.get_info("status/bootstrap-phase")`, an active round-trip query that correctly raises an exception on a dead or stale socket.
- **Watchdog: Ignored Auto-Healing Return Value (Killswitch Delay)** (`watchdog.py`): `run_watchdog_loop()` ignored the return value of `attempt_auto_healing()`. If the healing command itself failed (e.g. `nft` unable to re-apply rules), the loop would still wait 3 seconds, re-run the integrity check, detect the same failure, and only then activate the killswitch - creating a window where traffic could flow in cleartext. The emergency killswitch is now triggered immediately if `attempt_auto_healing()` returns `False`.
- **SELinux Module Version Inconsistency** (`scripts/install.sh`): The shell installer checked for the presence of the `ttp_tor_policy` module without verifying its version. If v1.0 was installed, the script would skip reinstallation while Python's `tor_detect.py` would still report the module as outdated (requiring v1.1). The check is now `grep -qE "ttp_tor_policy[[:space:]]+1\.1"`, consistent with the Python detection logic.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Watchdog Daemon & Emergency Killswitch (Proactive Integrity)**: Introduced a background monitoring watchdog service (`ttp-watchdog.service`) that continuously verifies session integrity (Tor socket connection or systemd service status, nftables 'inet ttp' table and 'filter_out' chain presence, and DNS overlay mount).
- **Proactive Auto-Healing**: Added capability to dynamically attempt single-strike repair (re-applying rules, restarting Tor, or re-mounting DNS resolv.conf) before taking drastic actions.
- **Hard Network Lockout**: Implemented `apply_emergency_killswitch()` which drops all incoming, outgoing, and forwarding network traffic (except `lo`) in case of a persistent two-strike integrity failure, sending system-wide alerts via `wall` and desktop notifications via `notify-send`.
- **LAN Bypass Automatic Control**: Integrated automatic LAN bypass (`--no-lan-bypass` to disable) which dynamically injects nftables rules to accept traffic destined for RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) and Link-Local (169.254.0.0/16) networks.
- **DoH/DoT DNS Leak Mitigation**: Mitigated DNS leaks by blocking outgoing DoT traffic (`tcp dport 853 reject` in the firewall) and forcing browser-level DoH to disable by mapping Mozilla's canary domain (`use-application-dns.net`) to `0.0.0.0` inside `torrc` via `MapAddress`.
- **Selective Root Routing**: Enhanced default security by routing all root processes (including `sudo` commands) through Tor. Added `--allow-root` to the CLI to explicitly opt-out and allow root processes to bypass Tor.
- **Watchdog CLI Commands**: Added Typer command group `ttp watchdog` (`start`, `stop`, `status`, `run`) and optional `--watchdog` / `-w` flags in `start` and `restart` commands.

### Fixed

- **CLI Non-Root Crashes**: Caught `OSError` in logging setup to prevent CLI crashes when calling `ttp --help` or commands without root privileges.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Volatile Standard Core**: Fully volatile runtime. All runtime metadata, locks, and logs are now stored in `/run/ttp` (tmpfs), leaving zero traces on the host's physical disk.
- **Native Service Management**: Tor runs as a dedicated `ttp-tor.service` systemd unit with a volatile unit file in `/run/systemd/system/`. This avoids hijacking the system's own `tor.service` and its sandboxing restrictions.
- **Port Conflict Resolution**: Set `SocksPort 0` by default and switched to a private Unix ControlSocket (`/run/tor/ttp/control.sock`). This allows TTP to coexist with other Tor instances without "Address already in use" errors.
- **Stateless DNS Overlay**: Replaced physical `/etc/resolv.conf` overwrites with a `mount --bind` strategy. This allows for a clean, non-destructive redirection of DNS queries.
- **Lazy Umount Fallback**: Added `umount -l` support to ensure the DNS overlay is successfully removed during teardown even if the resource is busy.
- **Mount Stacking Prevention**: Automatically clears stale DNS mount overlays to ensure absolute idempotency, even after unclean kills.
- **Graceful Teardown**: Sends a cryptographic `SHUTDOWN` signal to Tor before removing firewall rules, ensuring all circuits close cleanly and preventing cleartext `RST` packet leaks.
- **Pre-flight Safety Check**: Verifies sufficient `tmpfs` space before execution to prevent out-of-memory crashes mid-setup.
- **Persistent Entry Guards**: `DataDirectory /var/lib/tor/ttp/` preserves Entry Guards across runs for fast bootstrap.

### Changed

- **Volatile Logging**: Logs moved from `/var/log/ttp.log` to `/run/ttp/ttp.log`. The log size is now capped at 1MB to prevent memory exhaustion in the RAM disk.
- **Diagnostic Refactoring**: Updated `ttp logs`, `ttp status`, and `ttp diagnose` to reflect the native service management architecture.

### Fixed

- **Release packaging**: `packaging/release.sh` runs `python -m build` with a project-local temp directory (`.build_tmp`) so builds do not exhaust RAM-backed `/tmp` on small hosts. `TMPDIR` is not exported for the whole script, so later steps (for example `dpkg-deb`) still see a valid temporary directory.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Diagnostic Commands**: Added `ttp check` for quick network status and `ttp check-leak` for manual DNS/IP leak verification.
- **Log Streaming**: Added `ttp logs` wrapper to easily stream Tor daemon logs (`journalctl`) for debugging.
- **Restart Command**: Added `ttp restart` for quick session resets.
- **Configurable Timeout**: Added `--bootstrap-timeout` flag to `start` and `restart` commands (defaults to 180s) to support slower networks.
- **Emergency Recovery**: Added `--restore-only` flag to the `stop` command to force network cleanup and DNS restoration even if TTP crashed or lost its lock file.
- **Log Management**: Enabled `RotatingFileHandler` for TTP logs (`/var/log/ttp.log`) with a 5MB limit to prevent unbounded disk usage.
- **Firewalld Conflict Detection**: Added explicit detection and warning if `firewalld` is active during startup to prevent rule conflicts on Fedora/RHEL.

### Changed

- **Build Pipeline**: Extended the `verify` target in the Makefile to automatically trigger the packaging scripts (`make build`) upon successful tests.
- **Status Reporting**: The `ttp status` command now actively resolves the external IP (if connected) to display the active exit node.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- **CI/CD Automation (Makefile)**: Introduced a root-level `Makefile` to provide a unified entry point for unit tests and multi-distro Docker integration tests (`make verify`).
- **Project Renaming**: Officially renamed the project to `transparent-tor-proxy` for PyPI and native packages to improve clarity and avoid collisions, while preserving the `ttp` command for the CLI.
- **Call for Contributors**: Added a dedicated section in README.md to attract new developers and experts to the project.

### Changed

- **Repository Reorganization**: Professionalized the project structure:
  - Moved system scripts (`install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`, `restore-network.sh`) to `scripts/`.
  - Consolidated QEMU VM and Docker testing assets into `scripts/vm/`.
  - Integrated internal assets into the Python package namespace under `ttp/resources/`.
- **Modern Asset Management**: Transitioned from manual path manipulation to `importlib.resources` for accessing the SELinux policy source, ensuring compatibility with all installation methods (pip, venv, native packages).
- **Documentation Overhaul**: Renamed `TDD.md` to `architecture.md` and updated all documentation to reflect the new architecture and modern packaging standards.

### Fixed

- **Path Robustness**: All shell scripts and Makefiles now resolve the project root absolutely, allowing execution from any working directory without breaking relative paths.
- **CLI Help Accuracy**: Updated internal CLI help messages to point to the new script locations.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Exception Hierarchy**: Introduced `TTPError` base class and specialized exceptions (`FirewallError`, `DNSError`, `StateError`, `TorError`) for professional error handling and selective recovery.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrated GitHub Actions for automated quality assurance:
  - **Ruff**: Static analysis and linting for Python.
  - **ShellCheck**: Security and syntax auditing for shell scripts.
  - **Pytest**: Automated testing across Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13.
- **Resilient Verification**: Tor verification now queries multiple endpoints (`check.torproject.org`, `ipify`, `ifconfig.me`) to prevent failures if one service is down.
- **Settling Delay**: Added a tactical 2-second delay between Tor reaching 100% bootstrap and the initial IP verification to allow circuits to stabilize.
- **Native Packaging**: Fully automated build scripts (`build_deb.sh`, `build_rpm.sh`) and PKGBUILD for Arch Linux, including complete metadata and license files.

### Changed

- **Transparent SELinux Compilation**: TTP no longer ships pre-compiled opaque `.pp` binaries. The custom `ttp_tor_policy` module for RHEL/Fedora families is now compiled on-the-fly from its `.te` source during installation.
- **Hardened DNS Logic**: Transitioned from "best-effort" execution to strict verification. DNS configuration failures now trigger immediate alerts and automatic rollback to prevent IP leaks.
- **Stateless Firewall Architecture**: Transitioned to a dedicated `inet ttp` table. This eliminates the need for complex system ruleset backups and ensures atomic, risk-free cleanup via `nft destroy`.
- **Crash-Safe State Management**: Hardened session locking to handle read-only filesystems and unexpected process terminations.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the emergency recovery script `restore-network.sh` was deployed without content.
- Resolved multiple ShellCheck warnings related to word splitting and unquoted variables in `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh`.
- Corrected unused imports and linting errors identified by the new CI pipeline.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-10

- Initial internal release candidate.
- Core logic for firewall redirection (nftables) and DNS management (resolvectl).
- Basic Typer CLI interface.
